This is a simple Roll a Ball game made with Unity. The main Executable is under the Builds folder. If you wish to download, 
make sure you download the .exe file, "UnityPlayer.dll", and the RAB_Data folder as well.

Under Assets/Scripts, there are three scripts made by me that given the overall functionality to the main GameObjects.
  -Camera_controller.cs: Controls the movement of the camera to follow the ball without adjusting the angle.
  -Player_Controller.cs: Contains  funtionality of ball collision with pivk up objects, UI controls, and game logic
  -Rotator.cs: Controls the rotation of the pick up game objects.
